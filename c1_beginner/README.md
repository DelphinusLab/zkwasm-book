# ZKWASM for beginners

Delphinus lab provides solutions for trustless computation and an application SDK based on a zkWasm virtual machine. This document is written to describe basic usage of ZKWASM to run WASM based applications in command line. We assume the read knows the basics of the following:

1. Compile rust applications using cargo
2. Basics of Makefile
3. Configure environment variables
4. WASM tools (wasm2wat, wat2wasm, wasmopt)
